## Overview

::callout{title="Note" icon="i-heroicons-information-circle-solid"}
Extended Crafting is a mod built specifically for modpack makers. What you can craft using the different crafting mechanisms will differ from modpack to modpack.
::

The Crafting Core is one of the key components of the Combination Crafting mechanism. Along with [Pedestals](pedestal.md), the Crafting Core can be used to craft different items using energy and a combination of up to 49 different items.

## Usage

The Combination Crafting setup does not have a specific shape. The Crafting Core can combine items from any Pedestals placed within a **3 block radius**.

To place an item on the Crafting Core, you need to right-click on the top. Right-clicking on any of the sides will show a GUI which displays the current power, Pedestals in range, as well as the recipe being created. 

The Crafting Core must be supplied with power to craft. Once a valid recipe is placed the Crafting Core will automatically begin to craft. Once it has consumed enough power it will then combine all the items together and produce the output.
