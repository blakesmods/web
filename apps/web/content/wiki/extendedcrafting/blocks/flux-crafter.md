## Overview

::alert
Extended Crafting is a mod built specifically for modpack makers. What you can craft using the different crafting mechanisms will differ from modpack to modpack.
::

The Flux Crafter is an energy-based crafting mechanism. Each recipe takes a certain amount of energy to craft. The energy is provided to the Flux Crafter using [Flux Alternators](flux-alternator.md) placed around the Flux Crafter.

## Usage

Place the Flux Crafter in-world and right-click to view the GUI. Inside there's a 3x3 crafting grid, similar to a Crafting Table. Place your recipe ingredients into the grid.

If the recipe is correct, the Flux Crafter should start to take energy from all Flux Alternators placed within a **4 block radius**. You can tell if they're working if they are emitting particle effects.
