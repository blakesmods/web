## Fundamental Materials
The blocks and items added by Mystical Agriculture all require two base materials, [Inferium Essence](../items/inferium-essence.md) and [Prosperity Shards](../items/prosperity-shard.md).

### Inferium Essence
[Inferium Essence](../items/inferium-essence.md) can be obtained in multiple ways.
- Ores
- Mob Drops

While mining can be a fun pass time, there is a much more agricultural solution to collecting Inferium. 

You can also get Inferium Essence by killing mobs. Every mob has about a 20% chance of dropping an Inferium Essence when killed.

### Prosperity Shards
[Prosperity Shards](../items/prosperity-shard.md) are obtained by mining [Prosperity Ore](../blocks/prosperity-ore.md) in the ground. You can find the ore in the overworld between Y levels **0** and **50**.

## Growing Inferium
Mining Inferium can be lucrative to start, but in the long term it won't be enough. There is a much more scalable
solution to this: [Inferium Seeds](../items/inferium-seeds.md)!

### Inferium Seeds
[Inferium Seeds](../items/inferium-seeds.md) can be grown on any farmland. However, to be able to gain additional seed drops, they need to be planted on [Essence Farmland](../blocks/essence-farmland.md).

### Increasing Yield
You can get more Inferium Essence per harvest from Inferium Seeds by planting them on Essence Farmland.

[Essence Farmland](../blocks/essence-farmland.md) is created by crafting or by right-clicking on vanilla Farmland in-world with an essence.

Each tier increases the amount of Inferium Essence dropped by an Inferium Crop by 50%.

## Upgrading Essence
Inferium is only just the beginning. 

To upgrade the tier of essence, you will need an [Infusion Crystal](../items/infusion-crystals.md).

## Creating Seeds
Next you are going to want to create some [Seed Bases](../items/seed-bases.md) for use in the creation of any seeds you want.
Normal [resource seeds](../items/resource-seeds.md) require some of their respective resource along with the tier essence of the seed.

Mob seeds require [Soul Jars](../items/soul-jar.md) of their respective mob type. To collect souls, you need to have Soul Jars in your inventory and kill the mobs with a [Soulium Dagger](../items/soulium-dagger.md).

## Growing Crops
Resource Crops can be grown on any regular farmland. However, they will not drop additional seeds unless planted on [Essence Farmland](../blocks/essence-farmland.md).

Growing resource crops on Essence Farmland adds a 10% chance of dropping a second seed during each harvest. An additional 10% chance is added by growing the seed on the Essence Farmland of the same tier. If a seed requires Supremium Essence to craft, then growing it on Supremium Farmland will be the most efficient.

## Essence Gear
You can create [tools](../items/essence-tools.md) and [armor](../items/essence-armor.md) using the Inferium - Supremium essences.

These require Essence Ingots.
