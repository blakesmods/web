## Soul Gathering
To create seeds for mobs, you need to collect souls. This can be done in multiple ways.
- [Soulium Dagger](../items/soulium-dagger.md)

### Storing Souls
Souls are collected using [Soul Jars](../items/soul-jar.md). Each Soul Jar can hold the souls of a single mob type. The amount of souls required to fill a Soul Jar differs depending on the mob. 

## Soulium Dagger
The [Soulium Dagger](../items/soulium-dagger.md) is a special weapon that you use to collect souls from mobs. The basic Soulium Dagger gives 1 mob soul per kill.
