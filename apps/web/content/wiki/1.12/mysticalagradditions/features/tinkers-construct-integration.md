## Overview

Mystical Agradditions adds Tinkers' Construct integration, allowing you to create Tinkers' tools using Mystical Agriculture materials.

## Tool Materials

This integration adds tool materials for Inferium, Prudentium, Tertium, Imperium, Supremium and Soulium. These materials can be melted in a Smeltery and poured into Casts to create Tinkers' tool parts.

## Tool Modifiers
### Prosperous

Any tools or weapons with the Prosperous modifier will have a small chance to drop a [Prosperity Shard](../../mysticalagriculture/items/prosperity-shard.md). Each level adds a **0.5%** chance.

### Chunky

Any tools or weapons with the Chunky modifier will be able to collect [Mob Chunks](../../mysticalagriculture/items/mob-chunks.md), similarly to a [Soulium Dagger](../../mysticalagriculture/items/soulium-dagger.md).
