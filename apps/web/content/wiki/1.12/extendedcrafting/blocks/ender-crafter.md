## Overview

::callout{title="Note" icon="i-heroicons-information-circle-solid"}
Extended Crafting is a mod built specifically for modpack makers. What you can craft using the different crafting mechanisms will differ from modpack to modpack.
::

The Ender Crafter is a time-based crafting mechanism. Each recipe takes a certain amount of time by default, but this time can be decreased by placing [Ender Alternators](ender-alternator.md) around the Ender Crafter.

## Usage

Place the Ender Crafter in-world and right-click to view the GUI. Inside there's a 3x3 crafting grid, similar to a Crafting Table. Place your recipe ingredients into the grid and the Ender Crafter should begin to craft.

To increase crafting speed, place Ender Alternators around the Ender Crafter. Any Alternators placed within a **4 block radius** will increase the crafting speed. You can tell they are working if they are emitting particle effects.
