## Overview

The Automation Interface is a machine-block that is used to automate [Extended Crafting Tables](crafting-tables.md) and the [Ender Crafter](ender-crafter.md).

## Usage

Place the Automation Interface on top of an [Extended Crafting Table](crafting-tables.md) or [Ender Crafter](ender-crafter.md).

Next you will want to place all the items in the grid of the Table below for the recipe you want to automate. Once placed, open the Automation Interface GUI and click on **Save Recipe**. You can also delete or view the recipe from this screen.

You can then insert the items into the input slot to have them distributed amongst the connected crafting grid. You can insert items manually, using item transfer mechanics (like a Hopper) or by making use of the **Auto Insert** functionality of the Automation Interface.

Pressing the **Config** button in the GUI will show options for both **Auto Insert** and **Auto Extract** functionality. When enabled, the Automation Interface will insert/extract items automatically to/from the inventories to the directions selected.
