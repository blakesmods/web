## Overview

The Recipe Maker is a modpack developer tool used to easily create CraftTweaker scripts for [Extended Crafting Table](../blocks/crafting-tables.md) or [Ender Crafter](../blocks/ender-crafter.md) recipes.

## Usage

To create a recipe, first place the items in the pattern you would like inside one of the compatible blocks. Then, simply right-click the block with a Recipe Maker. The recipe will then be copied to your clipboard in the format you asked for. Just paste (ctrl + v) into a text editor.

If you shift-right-click the Recipe Maker in the air, it'll change between Shaped and Shapeless modes.
