## Overview

::alert{title="Note" icon="i-heroicons-information-circle-solid"}
By default there are no tools marked as useless. Whether this feature is used or not will depend on the modpack.
::

Any tools marked as a `Useless Tool` will be ineffective. Any tools marked useless will have a tooltip saying so.
