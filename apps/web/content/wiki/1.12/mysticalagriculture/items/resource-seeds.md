## Overview

Resource Seeds are the main purpose of Mystical Agriculture. These seeds can grow **more than 100** different resources, including Diamonds, Bones, Copper, Redstone and many others. When harvested they all drop their own [Resource Essence](resource-essences.md), as well as having a **5%** chance of dropping a [Fertilized Essence](fertilized-essence.md).

There are different tiers of Resource Seeds. The tiers are dependent on how rare the material grown is.

These seeds are created using materials, essences and a [Crafting Seed](crafting-seeds.md).

These crops cannot be grown using Bonemeal. Instead, they can be grown using [Fertilized Essence](fertilized-essence.md) or [Mystical Fertilizer](mystical-fertilizer.md). 

## Usage

Resource Seeds can be planted on any regular farmland.
