## Overview

Mob Chunks have a chance to drop from both passive and hostile mobs when they are killed with a [Soulium Dagger](soulium-dagger.md).

The drop chance for each Mob Chunk is listed in its tooltip.

## Usage

Mob Chunks can be used to create [Resource Seeds](resource-seeds.md) of the corresponding mob. Alternatively, they can be smelted into a Tiered Mob Chunk that can be crafted into a different mob chunk of the same tier.
