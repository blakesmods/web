## Overview

Fertilized Essence is an additional drop from [Resource Seeds](resource-seeds.md). Fertilized Essence works like Bonemeal, with the added benefit of being able to grow Resource Seeds.

Every Resource Seed has a **5%** chance to drop a Fertilized Essence when harvested.

## Usage

Fertilized Essence can be used in a couple of ways:

- You can use it like Bonemeal on any crop or plant to grow it.
- Use it to make [Mystical Fertilizer](mystical-fertilizer.md) or a [Watering Can](watering-cans.md).
