## Overview

Growth Accelerators are used to increase the growth rate of the plant planted above them. They have a range of **64 blocks** and can be stacked below each other to provide additional growth speed. 

## Usage

Place them underneath the block your plant is planted on. In the case of crops that would be underneath the farmland block. Stack additional Growth Accelerators below it for more plant growth speed.
