## Overview

::callout{title="Note" icon="i-heroicons-information-circle-solid"}
Jetpacks in this mod are completely configurable. Jetpack stats and materials may differ from modpack to modpack.
::

Jetpacks make use of Forge Energy to allow the player to fly. Higher tier Jetpacks can have greater speed and energy capacity.

## Usage

Jetpacks require Forge Energy to function. They can be charged using a charging block from any mod that supports Forge Energy.

The Jetpack engine can be toggled on and off using a keybinding (default `V`). When the engine is on you can press the Space Bar to fly.

Every Jetpack has a Hover Mode, which allows for more precise movements. Enabling this mode (default keybinding `H`) will cause your Jetpack to hover in place with varying levels of descent. While hovering your Jetpack will consume power.
