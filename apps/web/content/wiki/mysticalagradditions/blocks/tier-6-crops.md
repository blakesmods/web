## Overview

Mystical Agradditions adds a crop tier higher than Supremium for crops of very high tier materials such as Nether Stars. These crops are made using [Insanium Essence](../items/insanium-essence.md) and have some additional properties and limitations.

All tier 6 crops must be planted over a [Crux](cruxes.md). Without the proper Crux the plant will not grow.

Tier 6 crops also cannot be grown using [Mystical Fertilizer](../../mysticalagriculture/items/mystical-fertilizer.md) or [Fertilized Essence](../../mysticalagriculture/items/fertilized-essence.md). This can be changed however, so you may be able to in some modpacks. Additionally, it's not possible to get a secondary seed drop from tier 6 crops.
