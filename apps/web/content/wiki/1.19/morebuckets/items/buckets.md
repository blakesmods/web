## Overview

More Buckets adds buckets made of many additional materials. More importantly, some materials have increased capacity.

## Usage

Buckets with a capacity of 1 Bucket work exactly the same as regular Buckets.

Buckets with a greater capacity can hold multiple Buckets worth of fluids. The Buckets will prioritize picking up new fluids over placing fluids if there is still space available.

All Buckets work like fluid containers and as such fluids can be added and removed using similar means to many modded tanks. They also work in place of regular filled Buckets (ex. Water Buckets) in crafting recipes.
