## Overview

The Auto Crafting Tables provide automation abilities to [Extended Crafting Tables](crafting-tables.md).

## Usage

With enough energy, the Table will automatically move the output item into a second slot which can be extracted from using any item transfer mechanisms, such as a Hopper. This functionality can be toggled on or off by clicking on the downward facing arrow between the two output slots.

To set up a recipe for automation, you'll first need to set a recipe. This is done by placing the items into the grid as normal, then shift-left-clicking on one of the 3 recipe slots in the top left. Once it is saved you can then select or deselect that recipe by left-clicking. Shift-left-clicking on a saved recipe will delete that saved recipe.

Placing a Chest on top of the Table with a recipe selected will enable the auto-insert functionality. The Table will use some energy to pull any items from the Chest that can be used in the selected recipe.
