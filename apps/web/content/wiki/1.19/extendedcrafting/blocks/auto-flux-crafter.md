## Overview

The Auto Flux Crafter provide automation abilities to the [Flux Crafter](flux-crafter.md).

## Usage

To set up a recipe for automation, you'll first need to set a recipe. This is done by placing the items into the grid as normal, then shift-left-clicking on one of the 3 recipe slots in the top left. Once it is saved you can then select or deselect that recipe by left-clicking. Shift-left-clicking on a saved recipe will delete that saved recipe.

Placing a Chest on top of the Flux Crafter with a recipe selected will enable the auto-insert functionality. The Flux Crafter will use some energy to pull any items from the Chest that can be used in the selected recipe.
