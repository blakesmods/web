## Overview

Watering Cans are used to increase plant growth speed. Each tier has an increased range and growth tick chance.

## Usage

After crafting a Watering Can, you'll need to fill it with Water by right-clicking on a Water source block. Once it's filled with Water you can hold right-click on a crop to water the crops within the Watering Can's area of effect.

Essence Watering cans have the added benefit of auto-watering. Simply shift-right-click the Watering Can in the air to toggle the auto-watering on or off. It will have the enchantment glint when enabled.
