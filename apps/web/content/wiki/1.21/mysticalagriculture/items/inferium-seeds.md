## Overview

Inferium Seeds are one of the main ways to farm [Inferium Essence](inferium-essence.md). Just like [Resource Seeds](resource-seeds.md), these crops cannot be grown using Bonemeal.

## Usage

Inferium Seeds can be planted on any regular farmland. When planted on [Essence Farmland](../blocks/essence-farmland.md) they gain a **10%** chance to drop a second seed when harvested. If planted on Inferium Farmland specifically, they have a **20%** chance instead.

More importantly, Inferium Seeds planted on higher tier Essence Farmland will drop an additional **+50%** more Inferium Essence.
