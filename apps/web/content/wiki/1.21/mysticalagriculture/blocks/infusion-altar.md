## Overview

The Infusion Altar is the core component of the multi-block Infusion crafting structure. Along with [Infusion Pedestals](infusion-pedestal.md), the altar is mainly used to craft [Resource Seeds](../items/resource-seeds.md) and [Augments](../items/augments.md).

## Usage

::

To use the Infusion Altar, you must first place it down in the world. Make sure the surrounding area is clear of obstructions. Then, you must place [Infusion Pedestals](infusion-pedestal.md) around the altar. The altar will show ghost pedestals in the world, indicating where you must place the pedestals.

Once your altar is set up, you can place items on the altar and pedestals by right-clicking on them with an item in hand.

To activate the altar you can do one of the following:
- Provide the altar with a Redstone signal (ex. button, lever)
- Right-click on the altar with a [Wand](../items/wand.md)
