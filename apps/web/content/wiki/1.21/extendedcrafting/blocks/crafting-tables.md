## Overview

::callout{title="Note" icon="i-heroicons-information-circle-solid"}
Extended Crafting is a mod built specifically for modpack makers. What you can craft using the different crafting mechanisms will differ from modpack to modpack.
::

Extended Crafting Tables are a set of tiered Crafting Tables that can be used to craft a variety of items. Each tier has a larger grid which can be used to craft higher tier items with more components.

## Usage

Simply place the Table in the world and open the GUI. Items placed inside an Extended Crafting Table will remain when closing the GUI.

These Tables can be upgraded to [Auto Crafting Tables](auto-crafting-tables.md) to allow for auto-crafting and automation.
