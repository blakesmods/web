## Overview

Mystical Agradditions adds variants of [Inferium Ore](../../mysticalagriculture/blocks/inferium-ore.md) and [Prosperity Ore](../../mysticalagriculture/blocks/prosperity-ore.md) that generate in the Nether between Y levels **10** and **100**. 

These Nether variants drop slightly more items when harvested than their Stone counterparts.
