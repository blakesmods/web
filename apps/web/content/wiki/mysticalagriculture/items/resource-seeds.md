## Overview

Resource Seeds are the main purpose of Mystical Agriculture. These seeds can grow **more than 100** different resources, including Diamonds, Bones, Copper, Redstone and many others. When harvested they all drop their own [Resource Essence](resource-essences.md), as well as having a **10%** chance of dropping a [Fertilized Essence](fertilized-essence.md).

There are different tiers of Resource Seeds. The tiers are dependent on how rare the material grown is.

These seeds are created using the [Infusion Altar](../blocks/infusion-altar.md) with materials, essences and a [Seed Base](seed-bases.md).

These crops cannot be grown using Bonemeal.

## Usage

Resource Seeds can be planted on any regular farmland. When planted on [Essence Farmland](../blocks/essence-farmland.md) they gain a **10%** chance to drop a second seed when harvested. If planted on the Essence Farmland of the same tier, they have a **20%** chance instead.
