## Overview

The Experience Capsule is used to store experience points. It is mostly used to create Experience Seeds, but can also be used just as a way to hold experience.

## Usage

While in a players inventory, any Experience Orbs picked up by the player will automatically go into the Experience Capsule. 

Experience can be manually added from the players experience to the Capsule by right-clicking it. Experience can also be taken from the Capsule and added to the players experience by shift-right-clicking it.
