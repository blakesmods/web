## Overview

Inferium Essence is one of the key materials needed to craft Mystical Agriculture blocks and items. It can be collected in several ways:

- Mining [Inferium Ore](../blocks/inferium-ore.md)
- Killing both hostile and passive mobs
- Farming [Inferium Seeds](inferium-seeds.md)

## Usage

Inferium Essence is used to craft many of the core items in the mod, including [Resource Seeds](resource-seeds.md), [Essence Tools](essence-tools.md) and [Essence Armor](essence-armor.md).

It can also be converted into higher tier essences using an [Infusion Crystal](infusion-crystals.md), allowing you to create higher tiered seeds, tools and armor.
