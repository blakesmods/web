## Overview

The Soulium Dagger is a weapon used to collect Mob Souls for creating [Resource Seeds](resource-seeds.md) for Mob drops. 

The Soulium Dagger will give **1** Mob Soul value per kill. It can be upgraded using an [Infusion Altar](../blocks/infusion-altar.md) to be either Passive or Hostile attuned, granting an additional **+50%** souls per kill to applicable mobs. Additionally, you can enchant the Dagger to potentially get the [Soul Siphoning](../enchantments/soul-siphoning.md) enchantment for additional value.

## Usage

To collect Mob Souls using a Soulium Dagger, you will need one or more [Soul Jars](soul-jar.md) in your inventory. Any mob kills done with the dagger will add Mob Souls to a jar. The souls will prioritize going into jars that already contain that Mob Soul type.
