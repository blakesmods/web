## Upgrading Essence Gear
Tools and armor can be upgraded with [**Augments**](../items/augments.md)! Some Augments include Wither Resistance, Absorption, Speed, Jump Boost etc.

## The Tinkering Table
The [Tinkering Table](../blocks/tinkering-table.md) is used to add/remove Augments to your essence gear. The types of tool/armor that an Augment can be applied to are listed in the tooltip of the Augment.

### Applicable Tiers
Each augment has a tier. This tier is the **minimum** tier of gear that the Augment can be applied to. You can apply lower tier Augments to higher tier gear.

### Augment Slots
Each piece of gear can only have a certain amount of Augment slots. Most items only have a single Augment slot, but [Awakened Supremium](../guides/awakened-supremium.md) gear pieces have 2!
