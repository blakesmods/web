## The Infusion Altar
Seeds are crafted using an [**Infusion Altar**](../blocks/infusion-altar.md) and [**Infusion Pedestals**](../blocks/infusion-pedestal.md). Placing the altar in the world will show you where to place the pedestals.

### Placing Items
Items are placed onto the altar by right-clicking on the altar and pedestals with the items in your hand.

**Note:** You may place the pedestal items in any order you wish.

### Activating The Altar
Once you have all of your items placed, you can start crafting a recipe. To activate the Infusion Altar, you can either give it a Redstone signal or right-click on it with a [Wand](../items/wand.md).
