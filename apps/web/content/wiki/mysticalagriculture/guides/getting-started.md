## Fundamental Materials
The blocks and items added by Mystical Agriculture all require two base materials, **Inferium Essence** and **Prosperity Shards**.

### Inferium Essence
Inferium Essence can be obtained in multiple ways.
- Ores
- Mob Drops

While mining can be a fun pass time, there is a much more agricultural solution to collecting Inferium. 

You can also get Inferium Essence by killing mobs. Every mob has about a 20% chance of dropping an Inferium Essence when killed.

### Prosperity Shards
Prosperity Shards are obtained by mining Prosperity Ore in the ground. You can find the ore in the overworld at or below 
Y level 50.

## Growing Inferium
Mining Inferium can be lucrative to start, but in the long term it won't be enough. There is a much more scalable
solution to this: Inferium Seeds!

### Inferium Seeds
Inferium Seeds can be grown on any farmland. However, to be able to gain additional seed drops, they need to be planted on Essence Farmland.

### Increasing Yield
You can get more Inferium Essence per harvest from Inferium Seeds by planting them on Essence Farmland.

Essence Farmland is created by crafting or by right-clicking on vanilla Farmland in-world with an essence.

Each tier increases the amount of Inferium Essence dropped by an Inferium Crop by 50%.

## Upgrading Essence
Inferium is only just the beginning. 

To upgrade the tier of essence, you will need an Infusion Crystal.

## Creating Seeds
Next you are going to want to create some Seed Bases for use in the creation of any seeds you want.
Normal resource seeds require some of their respective resource along with the tier essence of the seed.

Mob seeds require Soul Jars of their respective mob type. To collect souls, you need to have Soul Jars in your inventory and kill the mobs with a Soulium Dagger.

## Growing Crops
Resource Crops can be grown on any regular farmland. However, they will not drop additional seeds unless planted on Essence Farmland.

Growing resource crops on Essence Farmland adds a 10% chance of dropping a second seed during each harvest. An additional 10% chance is added by growing the seed on the Essence Farmland of the same tier. If a seed requires Supremium Essence to craft, then growing it on Supremium Farmland will be the most efficient.

## Essence Gear
You can create tools and armor using the Inferium - Supremium essences.
These require Essence Ingots.
