## Overview

The Tinkering Table is a block used to add [Augments](../items/augments.md) to [Essence Tools](../items/essence-tools.md) and [Essence Armor](../items/essence-armor.md).

## Usage

Place a compatible tool or armor piece into the center slot of the GUI. On the right, 1 or more slots will be unlocked. There you can place any applicable [Augment](../items/augments.md). Remove the tool from the center slot and the Augment will have been applied. You can remove Augments at any time by placing the tool or armor piece back into the center slot and taking out the Augment.
