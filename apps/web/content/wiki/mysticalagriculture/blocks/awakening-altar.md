## Overview

The Awakening Altar is the core component of the multi-block Awakening crafting structure. Along with [Awakening Pedestals](awakening-pedestal.md) and [Essence Vessels](essence-vessel.md), the altar is mainly used to craft [Awakened Supremium](../items/awakened-supremium.md).

## Usage

To use the Awakening Altar, you must first place it down in the world. Make sure the surrounding area is clear of obstructions. Then, you must place [Awakening Pedestals](awakening-pedestal.md) and [Essence Vessels](essence-vessel.md) around the altar. The altar will show ghost pedestals/vessels in the world, indicating where you must place them.

Once your altar is set up, you can place items on the altar and pedestals by right-clicking on them with an item in hand. The same for the vessels, though they can hold up to 40 of an item.

To activate the altar you can do one of the following:
- Provide the altar with a Redstone signal (ex. button, lever)
- Right-click on the altar with a [Wand](../items/wand.md)
