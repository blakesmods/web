## Overview

The Harvester is a machine that will auto-harvest crops and re-plant them. Items collected by the Harvester are placed into it's internal inventory.

## Usage

Harvesters require energy to function. You can either provide energy via any Forge Energy compatible energy transfer, or use the internal solid-fuel based generator.

Once placed, the harvester will harvest a 3x3 area of crops in front of it. To increase the range of the Harvester, you can install a [Machine Upgrade](../items/machine-upgrades.md). Upgrades will also increase operation speed and internal energy storage capacity.

The harvester can be disabled at any time with a Redstone signal.
