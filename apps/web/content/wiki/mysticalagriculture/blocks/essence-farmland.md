Resource Crops planted on Essence Farmland will have a 10% chance to drop an additional seed. If they are planted on the **corresponding tier** of farmland then they will have a 20% chance to drop an additional seed.

Inferium Crops planted on Essence Farmland will have increased Inferium Essence output. Each tier of farmland adds **+50%** to the base drop rate of 100%.
