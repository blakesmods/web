## Overview

The Soul Extractor is a machine used for extracting Mob Souls from items into [Soul Jars](../items/soul-jar.md).  

## Usage

The Soul Extractor requires energy to function. You can either provide energy via any Forge Energy compatible energy transfer, or use the internal solid-fuel based generator.

Place a valid Soul Extractor input item in the left slot, and a [Soul Jar](../items/soul-jar.md) in the right slot. The machine will convert those items into Mob Souls and insert them into the Soul Jar until it is full. 

The machine can be upgraded using [Machine Upgrades](../items/machine-upgrades.md) for faster operation and increased internal energy storage.
