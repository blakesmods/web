The Seed Reprocessor requires energy to function. You can either provide energy via any Forge Energy compatible energy transfer, or use the internal solid-fuel based generator.

The machine can be upgraded using [Machine Upgrades](../items/machine-upgrades.md) for faster operation and increased internal energy storage.
