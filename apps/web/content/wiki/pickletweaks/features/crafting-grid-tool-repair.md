## Overview

Pickle Tweaks adds the ability to repair your tools using a crafting grid. This works similarly to an Anvil.

## Usage

Place the tool you want to repair into a crafting grid along with the items needed to repair that tool. The result will be your tool with more durability. Placing multiple repair ingredients into the grid will increase the amount of durability regained.

Certain tools such as Shovels will take less total items to repair fully.
