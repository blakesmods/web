The Quantum Compressor is an item used to create items using high quantities of inputs. One of these items is [Singularities](../items/singularity.md).

## Usage

Each Quantum Compressor recipe usually requires a Catalyst item and some quantity of ingredients. Place the Catalyst in the far left slot and the ingredients into the slot next to it. You can hover over the blue bar to see the current ingredient as well as how many of that item are in the Compressor. If the combination of Catalyst and ingredient has an output, it will show the progress to creating the resulting item.

The Quantum Compressor requires power to function. It will only use power when creating the resulting item.

The input slot will hold as many items as possible by default. This can be configured in the GUI to only accept the amount needed for the recipe by clicking on the lock.

To eject the ingredients from the Compressor, you can press the Eject button, and it will start to eject the items into the output slot.
