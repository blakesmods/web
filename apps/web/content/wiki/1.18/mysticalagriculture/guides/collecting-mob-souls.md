## Soul Gathering
To create seeds for mobs, you need to collect souls. This can be done in multiple ways.
- [Soulium Dagger](../items/soulium-dagger.md)
- [Soul Extractor](../blocks/soul-extractor.md)

### Storing Souls
Souls are collected using [Soul Jars](../items/soul-jar.md). Each Soul Jar can hold the souls of a single mob type. The amount of souls required to fill a Soul Jar differs depending on the mob. 

## Soulium Dagger
The [Soulium Dagger](../items/soulium-dagger.md) is a special weapon that you use to collect souls from mobs. The basic Soulium Dagger gives 1 mob soul per kill.

### Attuned Daggers
To increase the soul siphoning efficiency of the Soulium Dagger, you can upgrade it to have either a **Hostile** or **Passive** attunement. This is done using the [Infusion Altar](../blocks/infusion-altar.md).

An attuned Soulium Dagger will provide an additional 50% souls gathered from every mob that applies to the attunement. They also gain a slight damage increase. 

## Soul Extractor
The [Soul Extractor](../blocks/soul-extractor.md) is a machine that takes in mob drops (such as Rotten Flesh, Gunpowder, Bones etc.) and converts them into a certain amount of mob souls.
