[Awakened Supremium](../items/awakened-supremium.md) is used to create the highest tier [tools](../items/essence-tools.md) and [armor](../items/essence-armor.md). These gear pieces have greater stats and gain an additional [Augment](../items/augments.md) slot!

## Cognizant Dust
To create Awakened Supremium, you will need to collect rare material called [Cognizant Dust](../items/cognizant-dust.md). This is done by killing either a Wither or the Ender Dragon using an [Essence Weapon](../items/essence-tools.md) that is enchanted with [Mystical Enlightenment](../enchantments/mystical-enlightenment.md).

## The Awakening Altar
To create Awakened Supremium, you will need to build a special Altar. You will need an [Awakening Altar](../blocks/awakening-altar.md), [Awakening Pedestals](../blocks/awakening-pedestal.md) and [Essence Vessels](../blocks/essence-vessel.md). Placing the Altar in the world will show you where to place the Pedestals and Essence Vessels.

### Placing Items
Items are placed onto the Altar by right-clicking on the Altar, Pedestals or Essence Vessels with the items in your hand.

**Note:** You may place the Pedestal items in any order you wish.

### Activating The Altar
Once you have all of your items placed, you can start crafting a recipe. To activate the Awakening Altar, you can either give it a Redstone signal or right-click on it with a [Wand](../items/wand.md).
