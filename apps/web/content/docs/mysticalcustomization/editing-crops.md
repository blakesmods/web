Mystical Customization allows you easily edit registered crops. Here's how you do it.

## Editing A Crop
Crops are edited via a JSON file located in `/config/mysticalcustomization/` called `configure-crops.json`.

This file will contain an empty JSON object on first launch. You will use this as a crop ID -> crop changes map.

### Example Entry
```json
{
  "mysticalagriculture:iron": {
    "name": "Orange",
    "tier": "mysticalagriculture:5"
  }
}
```

## The configure-crops File
This section will go over the values available to use to edit crops. Syntax can be inferred from the example json below.

### Name
You can change the display name of a crop like so.
```json
{
  "name": "Test"
}
```

### Type
You can change the type of a crop using that type's ID. Learn more about types and how to add your own [here](adding-types.md).

**Note:** As of version 3.0.0, crop types must be prefixed with a mod ID. In this case it would now be `mysticalagriculture:resource`.
```json
{
  "type": "resource"
}
```
**Tip:** You can see all of the registered types in-game with the `/mysticalcustomization types` command.

### Tier
You can change the tier of a crop using the tier's ID. Learn more about tiers and how to add your own [here](adding-tiers.md).
```json
{
  "tier": "mysticalagriculture:1"
}
```
**Tip:** You can see all of the registered tiers in-game with the `/mysticalcustomization tiers` command.

### Ingredient
You can change the crafting ingredient used to craft a crop's seed. This can be either an item or a tag, and uses the same syntax as a crafting recipe.
```json
{
  "ingredient": {
    "item": "minecraft:iron_ingot"
  }
}
```

### Crux
You can change the required crux block to this crop. A crux is a block that must be placed underneath the farmland for this crop to grow.

**2.1.7 or later:** you can remove the crux from a crop by setting the value to `null`.
```json
{
  "crux": "minecraft:cobblestone"
}
```

### Enabled
You can disable a crop if you want to hide it.
```json
{
  "enabled": false
}
```

### Glint
<u-badge color="green">2.0.0+</u-badge>

You can enable the enchantment glint effect for this crops items.
```json
{
  "glint": true
}
```

### Required Biomes
<u-badge color="green">2.1.2+</u-badge>

You can specify required biomes for this crop to be able to grow in.
```json
{
  "biomes": [
    "minecraft:plains",
    "minecraft:desert"
  ]
}
```

### Base Secondary Drop Chance
<u-badge color="green">3.0.1+</u-badge>

You can modify the base chance of a second seed/essence dropping from the crop when planted on a valid farmland. Can be any value from 0.0 to 1.0.
```json
{
  "baseSecondaryChance": 0.4
}
```

### Essence Item
<u-badge color="green">3.1.1+</u-badge>

You can specify your own essence item. This is the item that will drop from the crop when harvested. 

**Note:** Setting this value will **not** prevent the crop's current essence item from being registered.
```json
{
  "essence": "minecraft:apple"
}
```

### Recipe Config
<u-badge color="green">3.1.2+</u-badge>

You can disable the auto-generated recipes for a crop.

**Note:** The auto-generated recipes for the Mystical Agriculture built-in crops are already disabled by default.
```json
{
  "recipes": {
    "crafting": false, // the vanilla 3x3 recipe (if enabled in the config)
    "infusion": false, // the infusion altar recipe for the seed
    "reprocessor": false // the default seed reprocessor recipe for the seed
  }
}
```

## Example File
```json
{
  "mysticalagriculture:iron": {
    "name": "Iron, but Modified",
    "tier": "mysticalcustomization:test",
    "type": "test",
    "ingredient": {
      "item": "minecraft:apple"
    },
    "crux": "minecraft:cobblestone"
  },
  "mysticalagriculture:stone": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```
