Mystical Customization allows you easily add your own mob soul types. Here's how you do it.

## Adding A Mob Soul Type
Mob soul types are added via JSON files placed in `/config/mysticalcustomization/mobsoultypes/`. Each file represents a new mob soul type to be added.

**Important:** The name of the file is used as the mob soul types ID. The ID **must** be all lowercase with underscores '_' in place of spaces.

## The Mob Soul Type File
This section will go over the values available to use in mob soul type file. Syntax can be inferred from the example json below.

**Note:** Any field below marked with a purple badge is required. Any field marked with a green badge requires at least the version specified.

### Name
You can manually set a name for this mob soul type. If you plan to use more than one entity you should probably use this.
```json
{
  "name": "Animals"
}
```
Omitting this field will use the default display name for the provided entity.

### Souls
<u-badge label="Required"></u-badge>

You must assign this mob soul type a required amount of souls.
```json
{
  "souls": 10.5
}
```

### Entities
<u-badge label="Required"></u-badge>

You must assign entities to this mob soul type.
```json
{
  "entities": [
    "minecraft:panda",
    "minecraft:polar_bear"
  ]
}
```
You can also just specify a single entity instead.
```json
{
  "entity": "minecraft:panda"
}
```

### Color
You should set the color of the Soul Jar for this mob soul type. Colors are set using HEX values.
```json
{
  "color": "aaaaaa" 
}
```

### Enabled
<u-badge label="2.1.2+" color="green"></u-badge>

You can disable this mob soul type during the creation process if you really want to I guess.
```json
{
  "enabled": false
}
```

## Example File
```json
{
  "name": "Test",
  "souls": 50,
  "entities": [
    "minecraft:panda",
    "minecraft:polar_bear"
  ],
  "color": "abcabc"
}
```
