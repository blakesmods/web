## Adding A Jetpack
Jetpacks are added via JSON files placed in `/config/ironjetpacks/jetpacks/`. Each file represents a new jetpack to be added.

## Editing A Jetpack
After initial load, all the default jetpack JSON files will be generated. You can then edit the values as you see fit.

## The Jetpack File
This section will go over the values available to use in jetpack file. Syntax can be inferred from the example json below.

**Tip:** Use the stats of the default jetpacks to decide what the values should be for your custom jetpacks, since the values themselves are quite cryptic.

**Note:** Any field below marked with a purple badge is required. Any field marked with a green badge requires at least the version specified.

### Name
<u-badge value="Required"></u-badge>

The name of the jetpack. **This name must be all lower case and have underscores for spaces.** This will be used for registry names as well as localized names. The name will be formatted automatically for localized names, including spaces and capitalization.
```json
{
  "name": "emerald"
}
```

**Version 6.0.1+:** Translation keys will be automatically created for the provided jetpack name. For example, a jetpack with the name `emerald` will have the translation key `jetpack.emerald.name`. You can use this key in your Resource Pack translation files to translate the name into different languages.
