Welcome to the Extended Crafting documentation. Here you will find information useful to you if you plan on using and configuring Extended Crafting in your modpack.

These docs are for versions 2.0.0 or later. If you are using an older version, head [here](https://github.com/BlakeBr0/ExtendedCrafting/wiki) for the old docs.

If you are looking for gameplay documentation, you should check out the in-game guide. Extended Crafting comes with a [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli) guide book right out of the box.
