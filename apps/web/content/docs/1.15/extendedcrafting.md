Welcome to the Extended Crafting documentation. Here you will find information useful to you if you plan on using and configuring Extended Crafting in your modpack.

If you are looking for gameplay documentation, you should check out both the [wiki](../../wiki/extendedcrafting) and the in-game guide. Extended Crafting comes with a [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli) guide book right out of the box.
