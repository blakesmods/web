Welcome to the Mystical Agriculture documentation. Here you will find information useful to you if you plan on configuring Mystical Agriculture in your modpack.

If you are looking for gameplay documentation, you should check out both the [wiki](../../wiki/mysticalagriculture) and the in-game guide. Mystical Agriculture comes with a [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli) guide book right out of the box.
